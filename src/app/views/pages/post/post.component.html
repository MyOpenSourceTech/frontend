            A database is an integral part of an application due to its ability to store, organize, and serve data.
            Developers are constantly trying to innovate databases to make them more efficient and powerful in order to
            serve the purpose of various applications. A common question that arises when choosing a database is whether
            to
            use a SQL database or NoSQL database.
            SQL
        </p>
        <p>
            SQL (Structured Query language) is the standard language for communicating with relational, table-based
            databases. Typically, these databases are called SQL databases. With SQL programming, you can easily search,
            insert, update, and delete database data.
        </p>
        <p>
            SQL is an incredibly powerful and versatile language, which makes it a very safe choice. With SQL, you are
            required to pre-define schemas that structure the way your data will be organized.
